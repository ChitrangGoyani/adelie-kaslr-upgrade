camellia-aesni-avx2-asm_64 - (camellia_ctr_32way) onwards missing
camellia-aesni-avx-asm_64 - (camellia_ctr_16way) onwards missing
camellia-x86_64-asm_64 - one line interchange (mostly the two lines dont affect each other so shouldnt matter)
cast5-avx-x86_64-asm_64 - 2 to 3 lines interchange, maybe already applied
cast6-avx-x86_64-asm_64.S - same as above
ghash-clmulni-intel_asm.S - applied
glue_helper-asm-avx.S - file changed completely
glue_helper-asm-avx2.S - file changed completely
sha256-avx2-asm.S - both functions changed but not drastically, fixable
